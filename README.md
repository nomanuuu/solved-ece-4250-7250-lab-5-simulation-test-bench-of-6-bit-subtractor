ECE 4250/7250VHDL AND PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC DEVICESLAB#5SIMULATION TEST BENCH OF 6 BIT SUBTRACTORI. ObjectiveThe objective is to learn writing a Test Bench for a 6-bit subtractor. You willsimulate your design using ModelSim and write a test bench for obtaining the simulationresults.II. Instructions!Read section 2.19, Page 119 Text Book for example on how to write Test Bench!Revise Class notes!Create a test bench for the 6-bit subtractor from lab 2!Provide 5 test samples to the subtractor and check the outputsIII. Deliverables1. Demonstration is required2. Pre- Lab: No Pre-Lab is required.3. Report:a. Objectiveb. Lab work:– Implementation: describe your design– Print and report the results including your codesc. Conclusion: What went wrong? Why? , And how did you solve it?
